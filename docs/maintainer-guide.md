# Maintainer Guide

The content for dwn-protocols.org comes from a [github
repo](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/dwn-protocols). The repo has
maintainers. This document explains the rules that maintainers follow as they
evaluate pull requests.

## Intent

This website's purpose is to help developers learn about DWN Protocol and then
discover and share protocols &mdash; NOT to opine about which protocols are good
or bad. dwn-protocols.org should play the same role for the DWN community that
pypi.org plays for Python, DIDComm.org plays for the Hyperledger Aries
community, npmjs.org plays for JavaScript, Maven Central plays
for JVM languages, and crates.io plays for Rust. The principle guiding our
maintenance is to help the site achieve this purpose. "Simple, clear purpose and
principles give rise to complex and intelligent behavior. Complex rules and
regulations give rise to simple and stupid behavior." (Dee Hock)

Most content on this website is about protocols. Specific instructions about how
to raise good PRs for protocols can be found [here](pr-guide.md). PRs to change
web site behavior or styles, to add more documentation, or to fix hyperlinks and
other bugs are also possible. All merges should further the site's overall
purpose.

## Checklist

Use the checklist below to stimulate thinking. Do not attempt deep curation;
rather, merge ensure that content meets reasonable and lightweight quality
standards, and then prefer to merge quickly.

1. _Content must be useful to professional software developers_. This probably
   means that PRs should contain more information than someone could find in a
   casual web search, should use tags and other site features intelligently,
   should be coherent and readable, and should not have broken hyperlinks or
   similar basic quality problems.
2. _Content must be contributed under an Apache 2 license._
3. _Content must be factual, legal, clean, and minimally controversial._ This
   means we cannot accept material that infringes copyright or licenses, that is
   a political lightning rod, that is branded or styled out of harmony with the
   rest of the site, or that constitutes self-serving advertisement.

   > A note about controversy: the "lightning rod" and "minimally controversial"
   > criteria are about _descriptive content_, not protocol specs. Assuming a
   > protocol is broadly legal and has legitimate uses, we are willing to
   > register it, even if its usefulness, its virtues, or its agenda are
   > controversial. What we cannot merge is inflammatory or divisive rhetoric.

4. _Content must be properly attributed._ Quotes, facts, and "see also"
   references need to be properly linked.

## Making Decisions

1. Trivial updates (e.g., to fix a typo) can be merged immediately by any
   maintainer, including the maintainer who submits the PR.
2. Merge decisions about meaningful content or about website changes can be made
   by an single maintainer other than the submitter. A maintainer may ask
   questions or request changes or comments first, at their discretion.
3. Difficult merge decisions require a consensus of all maintainers. The
   consensus must be announced in the comment thread of the PR, and must be
   followed by at least 1 week of public comment. Longer comment periods may be
   used, at the discretion of the maintainers.
